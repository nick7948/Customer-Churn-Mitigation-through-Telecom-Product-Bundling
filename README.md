# Customer-Churn-Mitigation-through-Telecom-Product-Bundling

This project uses SAS Miner to predict customer churn within a telecommunications dataset, helping to identify key drivers of customer attrition. By analyzing contract types, service usage, and billing preferences, we developed models that accurately classify high-risk churn customers.

# Methodology
Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed data, then visualized customer behavior patterns.
Modeling in SAS Miner:
Applied Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models.
SVM was chosen for its high sensitivity in identifying churn-prone customers (~85%).
Key Findings
High churn is linked to month-to-month contracts, high monthly charges, and DSL services.
Customers with bundled services (DSL + streaming) have increased churn probability.
Recommendations
Flexible Contract Options and Service Upgrades (e.g., DSL to fiber-optic) can enhance retention.
This SAS Miner project provides actionable insights for telecom companies to reduce churn and improve customer loyalty.
